# Rosslyn Clinic - AI Website Copy Generator

📋 Project Overview
This repository contains a structured prompt engineering system designed to generate professional, community-focused website copy for Rosslyn Clinic, a public healthcare facility in Rosslyn, Akasia, City of Tshwane, South Africa.
Unlike commercial businesses, public clinics require copy that balances professionalism with accessibility, clarity with compassion, and honesty about service limitations with community trust-building.

🏥 Business Chosen
Rosslyn Clinic

Type: Public medical clinic
Location: Rosslyn, Akasia – City of Tshwane, South Africa
Target Audience: Local community members seeking affordable, accessible healthcare

🎯 Problem Being Solved
Public healthcare facilities often struggle with:

❌ Unclear communication about available services
❌ Patient confusion about what to expect
